## ‚ú® Features

* **Interactive Message Sending:** Type messages in the integrated input area and press `Enter` to display them in the output canvas above, simulating a basic terminal or chat interaction.
* **Full Screen Experience:** The interface fills the entire browser window for an immersive TemPad feel.
* **Themed Preset Menu:** A dedicated side menu lists available themes, with its own styling that updates based on the active preset.
* **Responsive Design:** (Optional: Add this if you've implemented responsiveness beyond the basic stacking on small screens) The layout adjusts for different screen sizes.
